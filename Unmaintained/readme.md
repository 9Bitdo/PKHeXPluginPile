# Unmaintained Plugins
This is my attempt to at least keep some of the plugins that I used which were left unmaintained up to date with the latest PKHeX version. They won't be guaranteed to have the maintenance or language support that my plugins have.

## ThreeFinderPlugin
[Original source](https://github.com/suloku/PKHeXThreeFinderPlugin) by [suloku](https://github.com/suloku)

The purpose of this plugin is to find Dunsparce or Tandemaus which will give the Three-Segment or Family of Three forms respectively.
- *Three Finder* should now be in the *Tools* menu of PKHeX.

## Sword/Shield Event Editor
[Original source](https://github.com/darkfiggy/dmaxplugin) by [darkfiggy](https://github.com/darkfiggy) and [Radix Comet](https://github.com/RadixComet)

The purpose of this plugin is to edit the various events in Sword and Shield like the gift Pok√©mon and Max Lair.
- *Sword/Shield Event Editor* should now be in the *Tools* menu of PKHeX

## Sword/Shield Raid Tool
[Original source](https://github.com/Leanny/PKHeX_Raid_Plugin) by [Leanny](https://github.com/Leanny)

The purpose of this plugin is to display Sword and Shield raids and calculate den seeds.
- *Display Raids* should now be in the *Tools* menu of PKHeX
- *Raid Seed Finder* should now be in the slot context menu

**Note**: To use efficient seed calculation, you need to download `libz3.dll` and `Microsoft.Z3.dll` from `z3-<version>-x64-win.zip` provided by [z3 releases](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases) and place them in the *plugins* folder.
